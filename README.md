# Full Project Implementation - Beginner-friendly Web Projects

This repository contains three small, self-contained web projects you can open in a browser.  
Each project is short, beginner-friendly, and has step-by-step comments in the code.

## Projects
1. **project-1-portfolio** — Single-page personal portfolio (About, Projects, Contact).
2. **project-2-todo** — To-do list app that uses `localStorage` to persist tasks.
3. **project-3-product-listing** — Product listing page with filters and sorting.

## How to use (quick)
1. Unzip or open the folder.
2. For any project, open its folder and double-click `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Firefox).
3. Edit the files with a code editor (VS Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.) to customize.

## Step-by-step (create on your machine and push to GitHub)
1. Create a local folder and copy these project folders into it.
2. Open terminal in the folder.
3. Initialize Git and push:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: add three beginner projects"
git branch -M main
# Create a repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```
Replace `<your-username>` and `<repo-name>` with your GitHub details.

## Project-specific quick steps
### Portfolio
1. Open `project-1-portfolio/index.html`.
2. Edit About/Projects/Contact sections.
3. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser.

### To-Do (localStorage)
1. Open `project-2-todo/index.html`.
2. Add tasks, toggle them, and reload the page — tasks persist.
3. Explore the comments in `script.js` to see how saving/loading works.

### Product listing (filter & sort)
1. Open `project-3-product-listing/index.html`.
2. Use the category dropdown and sort controls to filter and order items.
3. Add products in `script.js` sample array to practice.
